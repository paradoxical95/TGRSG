This is Top Gear Random Series Generator (TGRSG)
I made this in Python because I was bored.
It's very simple anyone can make it. 
I made it because I was tired of finding websites that pick a random value for you.

I hope it acts as a simple tool to help your dilemma when you rewatch the BBC Top Gear (with OG Trio ofc)

On Linux - Simply get the .py file and run it as 
"python3 TGRSG.py" 
and enter input values accordingly.

For Windows, just download the .exe here on the right side and run it.
